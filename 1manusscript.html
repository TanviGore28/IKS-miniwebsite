    <h1>Ancient Manuscripts</h1>
    <p>The institute has a vast collection of manuscripts, including works
        in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and other ancient Indian languages.</p>
    <p>The government of Bombay, in 1866, started a pan Indian Manuscript Collection project.
        Noted scholars like Georg Bühler, F. Kielhorn, Peter Peterson, Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar,
        S. R. Bhandarkar, Kathavate and Ghate collected more than 17,000 important manuscripts under this project.
        This collection was first deposited at Elphinstone College in Bombay.
        Then it was transferred to Deccan College (Pune) for better preservation.
        After the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) was founded in 1917,
        the BORI founders proposed to offer even better preservation and research.
        Hence Lord Willingdon, the then governor of the Bombay Presidency and the first president of BORI,
        transferred the valuable government collection of manuscripts to the BORI on 1 April 1918.
        The first curator, P.K. Gode took active initiatives to enhance this collection.
        Presently, the Institute has over 29,000 manuscripts.

<p>The largest part of the collection (17,877 Manuscripts) is part of the "Government Manuscript Library",
     while there is an additional collection of 11,633 manuscripts. The most prized collections include a 
     paper manuscript of the Cikitsāsārasangraha dated 1320 CE and a palmleaf manuscript of the Upamitibhavaprapañcakathā dated 906 CE.

Among the several scholars referring to the works at BORI, the most well-known person arguably is the Bharat Ratna awardee,
 Pt. Pandurang Vaman Kane.[4]</p>
