    <h1>Library at BORI</h1>
    <p>We visited the library where rare books and manuscripts are stored. 
       The environment was peaceful and full of knowledge.The "BORI Library" refers to the
        Dr. R. N. Dandekar Library at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) in Pune,
         known internationally as a leading specialized library for Oriental Studies.
          It houses over 138,000 books and 28,000 rare manuscripts in various Indian and European languages, 
          with a focus on Sanskrit and Prakrit literature. Founded with a donation of books by Sir Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, 
          the library's collection has grown significantly through donations from other scholars and
           its role in preserving priceless historical documents, including birch bark manuscripts and ancient texts.
